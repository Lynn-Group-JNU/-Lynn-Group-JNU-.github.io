### Role of genetic ancestry in COVID-19 susceptibility and severity

As of January 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has infected over 98 million people and killed over [2 million worldwide](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).
People of African and Latin ancestries disproportionately [affected](https://blog.23andme.com/23andme-research/impact-disparities-of-covid-19/) by COVID-19 with respect to prevalence, morbidity, and mortality.

An individual's health is a result of complex interactions among one's [genetic](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/10/found-genes-sway-course-coronavirus), environmental, and [socio-economic](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/racism-not-genetics-explains-why-black-americans-are-dying-of-covid-19/) factors.
We leveraged RNA-Seq expression data and probed differences in gene-expression among people from European and African Ancestries. Although we could not control environmental and socio-economic factors (because of lack of metadata), we found differential expression of genes implicated in COVID-19 infection.
Further, African American gene expression signatures reveal an increased number or activity of esophageal glandular cells and lung ACE2-positive basal keratinocytes.

Our ongoing research, in collaboration with the COVID-19 International Research Team ([COV-IRT](https://www.cov-irt.org/)), aims to detect genetic factors that can explain the disparity of COVID-19 infection and mortality rate among different populations. 
We are particularly interested in identifying and examining the roles of human specific [orphan genes](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55136) and non-coding RNAs in COVID-19 infection.
