### About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology program at Iowa State University.
My dissertation is focused on the evolution of novel protein-coding genes in humans and is highly cross-disciplinary 
encompassing the fields of evolutionary biology, statistics, and computer science.

By training, I am a computer scientist (master's degree) and physicist (bachelor's degree) and have learned a great deal about biology, bioinformatics, and statistics during my Ph.D.
In general, my long-term research interests are developing machine learning methods and tools for biology and medicine.

Apart from my research, I love to read about diverse scientific disciplines -- anthropology, astronomy, ethology, neurology, philosophy, and sociology, to name some.
