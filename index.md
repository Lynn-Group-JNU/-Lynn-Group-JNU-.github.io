I am a bioinformatician and my main interests are in the fields of genomics and evolutionary genetics. Currently, I am working on various projects involving next & third generation sequencing including genome assemblies, annotation, and identification of structural variation. I am also  developing pipelines to streamline the assembly and annotation process for newly sequenced organisms. My long-term goal is to study the genome organization and evolution of grass species.

I am currently employed as an Associate Scientist at [Genome Informatics Facility](https://gif.biotech.iastate.edu/), and collaborate with Mattew Hufford, Eve Wurtele and MaizeGDB at Iowa State University, Ames, IA.

[**Workshops on UNIX, Phylogenomics** are at https://timotheenivalis.github.io//workshops/](https://aseetharam.github.io/workshops).
